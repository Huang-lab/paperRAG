selection is effective at accurately and thoroughly eliminating DNA below a desired threshold, we find that the total mass lost with this protocol is high, necessitating a higher input mass to ensure adequate yield.\\nThe Circulomics Short Read Eliminator kit has not been evaluated in the context of this extraction protocol, but it is commonly used in HMW DNA extraction protocols and is worth

PacBio sequencer.\\nAlthough generally quite comparable to one another, one potential advantage of the PacBio platform over the Oxford Nanopore MinION is that the PacBio system yields reads with relatively random error profiles, which are more easily corrected in assembly when compared to the frequent homopolymer errors of the Oxford Nanopore MinION platform12,13.\\nFor the purpose of this protocol, we recommend preparing DNA for nanopore sequencing by using the Oxford Nanopore Genomic DNA by Ligation library preparation kit, which incorporates steps for DNA repair, DNA end preparation

addition, this protocol includes AMPure bead cleanup steps that improve sample purity before sample loading.\\nTo ensure maximum yield and an optimized ratio of available DNA ends to sequencing

      "    Experimental design Sample lysis and contaminant digestion (Steps 1–7)—We recommend using samples that have been divided into aliquots and frozen as soon after collection as possible, because extended time at room temperature before freezing can lead to altered microbial abundance, as some taxa may die while others continue to divide17,18.\n",
      "When dividing stool samples into aliquots for DNA extraction, we prefer to use biopsy punches with plungers, which can precisely produce frozen stool aliquots and limit freeze-thaw cycles.\n",
      "Care should be taken to avoid injury when using these sharp tools, and we recommend placing the sample tube in a rack rather than holding the tube by hand during the punching procedure.\n",
      "When preparing aliquots, one should consider the biomass of the sample.\n",
      "If a stool sample has a lower biomass and is more watery in consistency, a greater total mass is recommended for extraction input.\n",

      "Size selection (Steps 13–15)—After DNA has been extracted, we recommend additional size selection to deplete shorter DNA fragments and enrich for longer fragments, as long fragments and their resulting long reads are critical for assembling contiguous genomes.\n",
      "There are several methodological choices for additional size selection, including size selection with the Sage Science BluePippin, the Circulomics Short Read Eliminator kit or Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization (SPRI) beads.\n",
      "Although BluePippin size selection is effective at accurately and thoroughly eliminating DNA below a desired threshold, we find that the total mass lost with this protocol is high, necessitating a higher input mass to ensure adequate yield.\n",
      "The Circulomics Short Read Eliminator kit has not been evaluated in the context of this extraction protocol, but it is commonly used in HMW DNA extraction protocols and is worth consideration here.\n",
      "For applications where input sample is limited, we recommend size selection with SPRI beads, as they provide further sample purification and reasonable yield, and the supernatant can be retained for additional selection steps.\n",
      "Typically, SPRI beads are used for sample clean-up and size selection.\n",
      "As the ratio of beads to sample is increased, the binding of smaller fragments to the beads becomes more efficient.\n",
      "Conversely, a lower ratio of beads to sample will lead to more stringent selection for longer DNA fragments.\n",
      "However, as standard SPRI beads are typically intended for size selection within a range of 150–800 bp, preparation of the SPRI beads for fragment selection >2.5 kb requires a custom buffer, as detailed in Materials.\n",
      "Given the variable nature of a custom buffer preparation, a range of bead-to-sample volume ratios should be tested with a non-precious DNA sample, such as DNA extracted from an abundant stool sample, to determine an appropriate bead-to-sample ratio to achieve peak DNA fragment lengths of >15 kb and minimal mass <2.5 kb.\n",
      "After size selection and an initial size distribution quantification with an Agilent TapeStation (see DNA quality assessment), additional rounds of size selection can be performed with lower bead-to-sample ratios to increase selection stringency if quantification shows retention of fragments below 2.5 kb.\n",
      "Conversely, the supernatant of each selection step can be retained for repooling in the event that the original selection was too stringent.\n",
      "The nuclease-free water volume for the final bead resuspension step can be altered to yield the desired input volume for downstream sequencing applications.\n",
      "We recommend resuspending the sample in 50 μl for downstream library preparation with the Oxford Nanopore Genomic DNA by Ligation kit.\n",
      "It is important to note that size selection may lead to bias in organismal relative abundance, as organisms that lyse more easily may have smaller DNA fragment sizes and be selected against during size selection.\n",
